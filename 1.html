  <h2>Analogram이란?</h2>
  All my life, I've tried to shoot
  <a href="http://analogram.studio/landing.html" target="_blank" title="analogram home">the decisive moment of life</a>,
  every moment of life was <strong>the <u>decisive</u> moment</strong>.
  <p>Analogram which combines the words 'Analog' and 'RAM'
  Translates in a literal sense to an analog saving book.
  We are all living within a concept we call time
  As we live our lives we collect memories along that line
  <img src="img1.jpg" width="100%">
  </p><p style="margin-top:60px;">We can easily numb ourselves from our human emotions and relationships.
  So. in light of this, Aboview had turned to the past to tap into the future.
  This project aims to capture those moments
  So the colors of those time are vivid
  And the intimate details are within it
  What we have created is a tribute to everyone's past present and future.
  A tangible sentiment that will protect your memories for a lifetime.
  This one is for the books.
  This is Analogram
